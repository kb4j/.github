A Java-native framework for RAG and content vectorization, designed to transform messy enterprise documentation (PDFs, PPTs) into structured, searchable knowledge. Built on Spring AI 
and MongoDB Atlas, it focuses on providing pluggable RAG strategies while mapping the trade-offs between cost, CPU utilization, and retrieval quality.

Intended Core Stack: Java 21+ | Spring AI | MongoDB Vector Search | WebSockets
